# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-Scikit-Learn
Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents. Think about, for example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in order to sort mail automatically and efficiently.
Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of printed books, for general electronic documents in which each character is well defined.

To address this issue in Python, the scikit-learn library provides a good example to better understand this technique, the issues involved, and the possibility of making predictions.The scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/) enables you to approach this type of data analysis. The data to be analyzed is closely related to numerical values or strings, but can also involve images and sounds.
There are various ML classifiers that can be used for predictions, Iâ€™ve used Logistic Regression for this.

# GOAL
This article presents recognizing the handwritten digits (0 to 9) using the famous digits data set from Scikit-Learn, using a classifier called Logistic Regression.
4-Step modelling pattern:
1. Import the model you want to use.
In Scikit-Learn, all machine learning models are implemented as Python classes.
2. Make an instance of the Model.
3. Training the model on the data and storing the information learned from the data.
4. Predicting the labels of new data,
using the information the model learned during the training process.
